                In Georgia, more than 800,000 cases of blindness and visual
                impairment have been reported. As these numbers increase, the
                need to have access to the printed word has never been greater.
                With community support, GaRRS will be able to continue this
                unique broadcast service, lifting the barriers of isolation from
                the lives of Georgia’s blind and print-impaired citizens. GaRRS
                is supported by government grants, universities, foundations,
                corporate gifts and by general donations from listeners and
                individuals like you. If you wish to join our efforts to keep
                Georgia’s blind, visually-impaired and print-impaired communities
                connected to the world of print, please consider making a tax
                deductible contribution. Visit our <a href="">donate page</a>
